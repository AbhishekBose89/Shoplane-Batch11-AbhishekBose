Shoplane
this is a ecommerce application where user can see all the products in home page also there are some category wise pages. Also user can add the product into the cart page. Also user can add product as a fevorite and later see in the favorite page. If the user click in a product card then user can able to see the product description along with images,ratings etc. Also in each product there is a toggle button by clicking user can easily add the product to cart or remove from cart. User can get the sum of Amount of all products that have been added to the cart. Also there is a simple login and register page along with forget password page.we can easily validate the user credentials. In this project I used Javascript library named REACT along with JSX,some third party libraies of react like react-router-dom, react-icons react-star-ratings etc, for state management I use Redux Toolkit and for styling purpose I used CSS and BOOTSTRAP.
